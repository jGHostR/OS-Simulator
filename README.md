# OS-Simulator
An OS-Simulator developed in C++ using multi-threaded programming with memory management to simulate the core concepts of OS like multiple types of CPU Scheduling, Teacher Assistant Evaluation Problem Using Semaphores, simulation of Banker's Algorithm, Memory Management with different Page Tables, and Page Replacement with Second Chance Algorithm.

Console Based Easy To Use Interface

**CPU scheduling:**
Implemented the following CPU Scheduling algorithms:
● Multilevel Queue Scheduling
● Multilevel Feedback Queue Scheduling
● Longest Job First
● Highest Feedback Ratio Next Scheduling

Choose parameters (i.e waiting
time burst time etc) for CPU Scheduling accordingly.

**Semaphore**
Deals with:
● Teacher Assistant Evaluation Problem

In this problem, there will be 1 teacher assistant, N chairs for students who will wait for evaluation, 1 chair for a student who will evaluate his/her
assignment.
● If there is no student then the teacher assistant will be busy with his work.
● If the student arrives, the teacher assistant will give an alert signal.
● If the teacher is busy in evaluation of student assignments then the other students have to
wait for their turn.

**Deadlock**
Deals with Banker's Algorithm
● Bankers Algorithm:

**Memory Management**
Implemented following Page Tables:
● Hash page table
● Inverted page table

**Page Replacement**
Implemented following Algorithm:
● Second Chance Algorithm
